The OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. It's a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, Swarm. The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:



Agents, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools

Handoffs, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks

Guardrails, which enable the inputs to agents to be validated

In combination with Python, these primitives are powerful enough to express complex relationships between tools and agents, and allow you to build real-world applications without a steep learning curve. In addition, the SDK comes with built-in tracing that lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and even fine-tune models for your application.
